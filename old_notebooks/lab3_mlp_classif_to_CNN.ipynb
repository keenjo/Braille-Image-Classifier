    "However, when training a classification network, we generally use the [Cross Entropy](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html#torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss) loss function, which alleviates these two issues. This loss is optimized for handling true labels instead of true probabilities per class, so you don't have to worry about it. Besides, it will automatically apply a [Softmax](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Softmax.html) non-linearity to the predicted outputs, in order to normalize them as probabilities per class.\n",
