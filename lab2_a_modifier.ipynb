    "# Regression in Pytorch\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lab, we have seen the basics of Pytorch and how to manipulate data through datasets and dataloaders.  However, the strength of Pytorch is its ability to define and train *models*. In this lab, we see how to do that for regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Â Preliminaries (course reminder)\n",
    "\n",
    " A model is basically a mapping (=a mathematical function $f$) between inputs $x$ and outputs $y$, such that $ y \\approx f(x)$. For instance, in age dection, the input data $x$ is the set of pixel values of a person's photo, and the output is the number $y$ corresponding to the age of that person.\n",

    "    \n",
    "To perform such a task, we have to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design a model $f$, that is, we specify a general mathematical function (e.g., a neural network) with some parameters (either a few or millions).\n",
    "- Train $f$ using a dataset of known image/age pairs (a *training dataset*) in order to adjust the parameters of the model. We do that by considering an *optimization* problem: ideally, we want the predicted age $y_{\\text{pred}} = f(x)$ to be as close as possible to the true age $y$. Therefore, we define a *loss function* which measures the difference between $y$ and $y_{\\text{pred}}$, and we want adjust the parameters of the model $f$ such that they minimize this loss function. This is achieved by using an optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent, which is directly implemented in Pytorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model is designed and trained, we can use it for performing predictions on novel data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, there are basically two types of tasks in machine learning, depending on the nature of the output $y$:\n",
    "- if $y$ can take only a finite number of values (usually represented as integers), then it's a *classification* task. The most basic case is when there are only two possible classes (binary classification). Examples are hate speech detection (1 = hate, 0 = no hate), recommender systems (1 = like, 0 = dislike), spam detection (1 = spam, 0 = not spam), etc.\n",
    "- if $y$ ranges in a continuous (and therefore infinite) set of values, then it's a *regression* task. Examples are age prediction as above ($y \\in [0, 100]$, or any arbitrary high value), estimating the price of a product, weather forecast, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will study classification in the next lab. In this one, we focus on regression, and we consider generic numerical data $x$ and $y$. But before diving into regression, let's learn a bit about the Autograd module."
